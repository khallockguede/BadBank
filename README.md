# Bad Bank

<img src=./BadBank.png>

## Description:
<p> This is basic banking app. <br> The user can deposit money, withdraw money and create new accounts. <br> There is validation on the "Create Account", "Deposit", and "Withdraw" pages. <br>The user cannot withdraw more money than they have in their account. </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> Start a local server. </br> Open the "index.html" file and start using the app.</p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add a login page to validate who the user is and to track their balance. </p>
