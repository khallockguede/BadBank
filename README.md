# Bad Bank

<img src=./BadBank.png>

## Description:
<p> This is a basic banking app. <br> The user can deposit money, withdraw money and create new accounts. <br> There is validation on the "Create Account", "Deposit", and "Withdraw" pages. <br>The user cannot withdraw more money than they have in their account. <br> I built this app for my Professional Certificate in Coding: Fullstack with MERN MIT xPro program. </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> Install dependencies. <br> Run a Docker and connect the localhost to Studio 3T. <br> Run "node index.js" from the terminal.</p>

## Features: 
<p> The landing page includes two options: Login & Create Account. Once the user is logged in then the options change to Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, AllData & Logout. <br> Users cannot withdraw more money than available in their balance. </p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add validation. </p>
